           <h4>Our Story</h4>
           <p>
            It all started when I visited my grandmother. She’s a lively 78-year-old who loves gardening and storytelling, but managing her medications had become a daily struggle. One evening, I found her confused and worried, having missed her pills again. Seeing her distress broke my heart and sparked an idea.

 We hope this system can bring the same relief and happiness to many more families, ensuring better health and independence for our elders.
